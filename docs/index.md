## Unit Test

Unit testing is preformed using [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/). 

### Setup

The unit test utilize the [symonfy/http-client](https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_client.html) and requires that the
environment variable `API_URL` is set in the projects `phpunit.xml` configuration file. To accomplish this use the 
following guidelines:

```shell
$ cd [project directory]
$ cp phpunit.xml.dist phpunit.xml
```
Set the `API_URL` environment variable to suit your needs. The default setting assumes that the local environment is 
utilizing the development server provided by Symfony CLI. For more information on Symfony local web server can be found
[here](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/symfony_server.html).

```shell
$ symfony server:start -d
```
or to see the server log omit the `-d` option
```shell
$ symfony server:start
```
It is typically best to use the phpunit CLI bundled installed by composer. It is found in the `vendor/bin` directory.
Invoking the unit test as follows:

```shell
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
```

The expected output is:
```shell
